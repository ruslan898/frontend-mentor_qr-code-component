## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS styling
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

By building this project, I've learned how to make basic HTML layouts and styling them with CSS using tag and class selectors

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1 class="title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
```
```css
.title {
  color: var(--color-slate-900, rgba(31, 49, 79, 1));
  font-size: 22px;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 120%;
  letter-spacing: 0px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I plan on using Flexbox and Grid to better my skills and understanding of this technologies
